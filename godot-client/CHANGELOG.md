# BattleBlitz Godot Client Changelog

## 2026-07-27

- Added `assets/tilesets/` as the preferred atlas-sheet home for map art.
- Wired the three new 48px-grid map sheets into `Config.TILESET_ATLAS_COORDS`.
- Updated `TileSetBuilder` so configured atlas sheets become shared runtime `TileSetAtlasSource` resources before legacy per-tile PNG fallback.
- Updated `MapLoader` to paint configured atlas coordinates directly.
- Routed transparent forest/mountain-style tiles through overlay layers so they render above biome-appropriate base ground.
- Added a focused `tileset_atlas_test` scene and smoke-test assertions for the new atlas mapping.
- Fixed Godot client movement previews so allied units are pass-through but not valid destinations; enemy units still fully block movement.
- Upgraded atlas rendering to parse sibling `.txt` label maps, grouping same-terrain variants by biome and selecting stable per-cell variants across each map.
